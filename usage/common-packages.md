# Common packages
This page provides support with commonly used python packages and libraries, for tasks such as machine learning, numerical analysis, and data manipulation and visualization.

## Machine Learning
The major machine learning python package is [`sk-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
This library provides interfaces and APIs for the most common ML algorithms such as SVM, PCA, linear regression, nearest neighbors, and the likes, as well as functions for data preprocessing, and dataset handling.
Moreover, it is designed to work seamlessly with numpy, matplotlib, and others.

There are many deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, Theano, PyTorch, CNTK, or Caffe.
These are low-level libraries providing high performances at the price of a steel learning curve.

Most often, it is desirable to use a high-level library which employs any of the above as backends.
The most common ones are:
- [`keras`]()


## Audio processing
- [`libROSA`]()
- [`scipy`]()

## Data manipulation/visualization
- [`libROSA`]()
- [`pandas`]()
- [`matplotlib`]()
- [`numpy`]()

## Sample conda environment

### Tensorflow/keras 

```yml

```
