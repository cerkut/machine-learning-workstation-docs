# Introduction

This section covers common system administration tasks, such as creating/deleting users, managing disk resources, system maintenance, and so forth.

Please note how most of the commands mentioned here require administrative \(\_root\_\) privileges to be executed. Student accounts don't usually come with administrative permissions, however you can [contact the machine administrator](mailto:gpa@create.aau.dk) if you would like to be granted the extended permission.
