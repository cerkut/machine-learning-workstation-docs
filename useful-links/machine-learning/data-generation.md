# Data Generation

#### Data Augmentation

Data augmentation encompasses a range of modifiers to a set of original data in order to generate “new” training data. These modifiers include \(but not limited to\) adding noise, random jitters, data scaling, shifting or translation and rotation.

#### Scraping the Web

Web Scraping or Web Harvesting is the process of automatically mining data \(such as articles, images, video etc\) from the Web.  Current web scraping solutions can be fully automated systems but sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human’s manual examination and in many cases this may be the only applicable solution \( e.g. websites prohibiting machine automation\)
