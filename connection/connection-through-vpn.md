# Connection through VPN

In order to connect to the ML workstation from outside of the AAU network, you'll have to install a VPN. 
Once installed, it will run in the background and will be constantly active. 
Connecting through the VPN avoids having to authenticate through the Microsoft Authenticator app.
Please refer to [this guide](https://www.en.its.aau.dk/instructions/VPN/) for installing and setting up the VPN on your local machine.
