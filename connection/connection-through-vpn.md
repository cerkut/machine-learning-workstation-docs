# Connection through VPN

In order to connect to the ML workstation from outside of the AAU network, you'll have to install a VPN. Once installed, it will run in the background and will be constantly activated. Please refer to [this guide](https://www.en.its.aau.dk/instructions/VPN/) for installing and setting up the VPN on your local machine.
